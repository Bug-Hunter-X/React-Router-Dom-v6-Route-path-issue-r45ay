# React Router Dom v6 Route Path Issue

This repository demonstrates a seemingly simple issue with React Router Dom v6 where a route fails to render correctly despite seemingly valid configuration.

## Bug Description

The application uses React Router Dom v6 to manage navigation between three components: Home, About, and Contact.  While the Home and About components render as expected, the Contact component consistently fails to render when navigating to '/contact'.  This occurs even with seemingly correct path definitions and component implementations.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## How to Reproduce

1. Navigate to `/` (Home).
2. Navigate to `/about` (About).
3. Navigate to `/contact` (Contact does not render).

The issue appears to stem from a subtle error within the route definition or a potential interaction between routes.  The solution provides a fix and explanation.
